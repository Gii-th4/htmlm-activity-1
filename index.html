          In the last decade, the area of artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded with interesting and promising
          results. With major achievements in image recognition, speech recognition and highly complex games, AI
          continues to disrupt society. This blog post will discuss practical applications of AI, optimization and
          interpretability of deep learning models and reinforcement learning (RL), based on the 2018 REWORK Deep
          Learning Summit in Toronto. Four software engineers from Knowit had the pleasure of travelling to Canada to
          attend this conference, and with renowned speakers such as Geoff Hinton attending, it turned out be an
          insightful experience.

        </p>
        <h3>Practical Predictions and Applications of AI</h3>
        <p>
          Early AI revolved around perceiving, deciding and acting. Today, the addition of learning is also in place,
          but due to the non-deterministic nature of the real world, decisions cannot be made purely from the facts that
          are given. Further development of AI will require improvements in a variety of areas. Andrew W. Moore, Dean of
          the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, shared his thoughts on what he thinks will be important.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, game theory provides an improvement to the decision making capabilities of an AI model, as the most
          probable answer is not always the correct answer. This can be explained from his example of an AI trying to
          predict the whereabouts of poachers in a national park. At first, the AI performed well at predicting the
          location of poachers, however, after a while the poachers in the national park learned from this and went to
          less obvious locations. As a result of this, the AI degenerated in performance. To improve the AI, game theory
          was introduced. By viewing the poachers as other players in a game, the AI was able to predict where the
          poachers were located even though they were not necessarily located at the optimal locations.
        <p>
          Secondly, autonomous AI is much researched these days. This enables, e.g., smaller robots to work together to
          solve a larger problem, in addition self-optimizing code, which means that the efficiency of an algorithm
          written by a human can be improved by an AI. These are only a few of the possibilities with more autonomous
          AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          As presented by Tzvi Aviv, Founder & CEO at AgriLogicAI, AI can lead to major improvements in the agriculture
          and food sector. In his presentation he showed that AI can be used in conjunction with geospatial data to
          increase productivity, profitability and sustainability in the agriculture and food sector. By using remote
          sensing yield performance of soy varieties, soil data, weather data and genetic data of soy varieties,
          AgriLogicAi created an Ensemble of Cubist model, a type of rule-based model, model which projected a 5%
          increase in soy yields by optimizing the selected soy variety given an area. This and other innovations to the
          agricultural food industry will become more and more important as we are facing a difficult time ahead with
          more challenging weather conditions.

        <p>
          Nargiz Mammadova, founder & CEO at Destin AI, talked about the use of AI in immigration. To settle down in a
          new country you would have to fill out many forms and be approved for citizenship through various
          applications. Yet, before the actual application process, you would have to navigate through the bureaucratic
          process of identifying and localizing these applications. This is where AI could be helpful, exemplified by
          the AI assistant Destin AI are currently working on, which can provide and effective interface for users to
          interact with. The involvement of RPA together with an AI-powered platform could potentially decrease refusal
          rate and repetitive admin work, in addition to boosting the efficiency and accuracy of information to the
          user. Furthermore, it could increase the number of applications, approval rate and the speed of the
          application process. Mammadova also presented the possibility of predicting the outcome of an application and
          identifying reasons for approval and rejection. As a result, the application reviewers can use more time on
          the applications that are difficult and require more time to assess.

          Brendan Frey, Co-Founder, CEO at Deep Genomics and Professor at the University of Toronto, provided an insight
          to AI in the pharmaceutical industry. He pointed out that 65% of all people will be affected by a genetic
          disease over a lifetime and health budgets in most countries are extremely high. In combination with a rapidly
          decreasing internal rate of return for research and development in the pharmaceutical industry, the old way of
          discovering new drugs is broken. AI needs to be further explored in this field and, as mentioned in his paper,
          can most certainly help with this by aiding in finding new drugs and personalize treatment according a
          personâ€™s genome. With the human genome mapped and the large amount of datasets available, training sequence
          models capable of discovering genes with unfavourable traits and mutations is not far from reality.
        </p>
        <h3>Optimization and Robutness of Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Another big topic in the future of AI is optimization of deep learning and how to make deep neural networks
          more robust. A known example of how fragile neural networks can be, is this adversarial demonstration from
          Explaining and Harvesting Adversarial Examples:
        </p>
        <img src="img2.webp" alt="" class="ads" />
        <p>
          In this example the network can detect the panda in the image to the left. Now, if you alter that picture by
          adding a toned down image of noise with gibbon-like features, the network will classify the image as a gibbon.
          However, to the human eye the picture has not been altered at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers at McGill University are trying to address this by using Lipschitz regularization while performing
          adversarial training as presented at the REWORK deep learning summit Toronto 2018. The Lipschitz constant
          measures the amplification factor of a perturbation, and by adding this to the loss function during training
          of a neural network, one can improve the adversarial attack robustness with a significant amount.

        </p>
        <p>
          Another challenge for AI is processing power. In the future we want the machine learning models to run on
          embedded devices such as phones and in cars, but the amount of processing power currently present in these
          devices are not on the same level as computers. Snapchat uses neural networks in their filters, and are
          working on making these networks runnable on your phone. One way Snapchat is trying to solve this issue is by
          model compression; how can we keep the high accuracy, but lower the computational complexity? Their idea is to
          use weight sampling, as convolutional filters are, in their words, highly redundant. Snapchat has developed
          new features, allowing 5x3 (15) weights be condensed to 7 weights, thereby reducing the memory usage by more
          than 50%. sint nihil alias error deleniti magni, numquam ullam
          enim blanditiis. Nam eveniet amet possimus saepe consequatur et,
          inventore minus?
        </p>
        <p>
          The University of Guelph (UoG) are also working on deep learning optimization. ML practitioners often assume
          they have a 32-bit floating point data type easily accessible. However, by using lower precision one can
          greatly increase speed and memory advantages. Researchers from UoG are working on methods to train networks
          with binary weights and activations at run time. In addition to memory advantages and higher speed, they
          report that the binary networks are also more resistant to adversarial attacks!

        </p>
        <p>
          An older paper (2015) from Geoffrey Hinton also touches upon optimization of deep learning by distilling the
          knowledge from an ensemble of models into a single model, thus reducing the need for multiple models and
          memory. Maybe this can minimize the need of processing power in the future?
